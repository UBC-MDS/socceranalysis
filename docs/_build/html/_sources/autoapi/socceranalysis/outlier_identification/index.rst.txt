.. py:function:: get_outliers(df, col, method='SD', thresh=3)

   Returns outliers in the dataset based on values of a variable

   This function identifies outliers in the dataset based on either of the following methods:

   1. Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: Identifies all values less than Q1 - 1.5*IQR and
   greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR where IQR = Q3-Q1, are identified as outliers.

   2. Mean and Standard Deviation Method: Identifies all values less than
   mean - k*standard_deviation and greater than mean + k*standard_deviation as outliers.

   :param df: Dataframe in  which outliers are to be identified.
   :type df: dataframe
   :param col: Variable in the dataframe based on which outliers are to be identified.
   :type col: str
   :param method: Name of the outlier identification method to be used.
                  "IQR" for IQR method and "SD" for mean and standard deviation method.
   :type method: str
   :param thresh: The value of k in the Mean and Standard Deviation Method formula above.
   :type thresh: int

   :returns: Subset of original dataframe  containing only rows corresponding to outliers.
   :rtype: dataframe
